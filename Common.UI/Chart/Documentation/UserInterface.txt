- ChartPanelCursor: 
	- There are two modes in which the cursors work: 
		- Point: a single cross is displayed
		- Region: two crosses span a rectangle to:
				- select Timeseriess ( +Shift): alle paths that instersect with the rect will be added to the selection
				- zoom in ( +Ctrl): zoom exactly to the positions you selected the end-point is lower and right to the start-point
				- zoom out ( +Ctrl): zooms out in relation of selected rect and Window-Size
				- zoom in/out is depends on each axis separately. This means you can zoom in Y but zoom out X with one rect (depends on the direction you have drawn it)
	- Each cursor can be permanent, which means that it is still displayed when the mouse is released,
		or not permanent which means that it is destroyed after the mouse was released
