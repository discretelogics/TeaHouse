Performance-Test Custom-painter against built-in slice-painter.
Tested with OHLCV-Ts with candle-geometry. Screen was 150 slices wide.
The execution-time was measured for the complete Draw-method.
Both painters where measured for exactly the same slices (max and max-1).
Both painters returned the same geometry.
