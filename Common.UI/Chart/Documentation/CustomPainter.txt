Preliminary Considerations

cp = Custom Painter

* During development of a custom painter, the painter code must be hosted out of process to allow debugging.
This is currently of minor interest, since we believe that painter code remains simple and debugging is not too much of concern.

* Registration and Hosting
- Painter Discovery: Type Discovery inside assmbly by base type CustomPainter (maybe later via attributes)
                     Assembly Discovery: a painter plugin directory is specified via Settings

- Painter Loading: AppDomain.Load into Process of VS (this will leak assemblies in the VS process, but only during development)
                   Alternatively, a direct load mightbe specified, if this makes sense from performance view
                   Shadow copy (to avoid locking and allow development of new cp assemblies)
                   VS loads all assemblies inside the cp-directory at startup and listens for changes
