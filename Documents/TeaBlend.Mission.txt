- programmming model that unifies historical analysis and stream processing by simulation
- programmming model that operates on ticks instead of prepared evenly time-spaced series and matrices
- high performance
- data visualisation coding goes hand in hand with model research
- openness - results are stored in files that are accessible from every program
- best debugging experience (visualizers)

less important features
- visual algorithm design (simple extensions inside the code editor or visual dsl)
